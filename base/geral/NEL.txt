Entity Discovery and Linking
In Entity Linking, the second stage of EDL, you will indicate whether or not the entities
annotated and clustered together in the Entity Discovery stage are included in the
Knowledge Base (KB). This is done by searching the KB interface in the tool for an entity,
determining the proper corresponding entry, and then selecting one of the following labels:
- Linking them to KB entries in which they are the central topic
- Marking them as NIL (i.e., not included in the KB)
- Marking them as Unknown (i.e., impossible to determine whether the mention is for
any particular entity in the KB)

Five entity types are to be annotated, for all languages in 2016 EDL:
persons (PER)
organizations (ORG)
geo-political entities (GPE)
locations (LOC)
facilities (FAC)

PER is limited to individual humans. Groups of people (including e.g., families, sisters,
married couples, etc.) are not valid person entities for EDL.

A facility is a functional, primarily man-made structure. This includes buildings and similar
facilities designed for human habitation, such as houses, factories, stadiums, office buildings,
gymnasiums, prisons, museums, and space stations; objects of similar size designed for
storage, such as barns, parking garages and airplane hangars; elements of transportation
infrastructure, including streets, highways, airports, ports, train stations, bridges, and tunnels.
Roughly speaking, facilities are artifacts falling under the domains of architecture and civil
engineering.

Locations (LOC)
Location entities are geographically or astronomically defined places that do not have a
political component or natural structures like bodies of water and mountains. Examples of
place-related strings that are tagged as LOC include heavenly bodies, continents, non-
politically-defined regions, oceans, seas, straits, bays, channels, sounds, rivers, islands,
lakes, parks, and mountains.

GPEs are composite entities comprised of a government, a physical
location, and a population, with common types including countries, states, provinces,
counties, cities, and towns.
