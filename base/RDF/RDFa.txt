RDFa Lite 1.1 documen use only five attributes; vocab, typeof, property, resource, and prefix.

if you wanted to talk about People, the vocabulary that you would use would specify terms like name and telephone number.
<p vocab="http://schema.org/" prefix="ov: http://open.vocab.org/terms/" resource="#manu" typeof="Person">
   My name is
   <span property="name">Manu Sporny</span>
   and you can give me a ring via
   <span property="telephone">1-800-555-0199</span>.
   <img property="image" src="http://manu.sporny.org/images/manu.png" />
   My favorite animal is the <span property="ov:preferredAnimal">Liger</span>.
</p>

Acima é definido <http://example.org/people#manu>.

<div vocab="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/" typeof="Person"><p>
  <p>
    <span property="name">Alice Birpemswick</span>,
    Email: <a property="mbox" href="mailto:alice@example.com">alice@example.com</a>,
    Phone: <a property="phone" href="tel:+1-617-555-7332">+1 617.555.7332</a>
  </p>
</div>

in the absence of a resource attribute, the typeof attribute on div implicitly sets the subject. That is, the name, email address, and phone number are associated with a new node of type Person. This node has no URL to identify it, so it is called a blank node as shown on the figure: 

_:blanknode1 rdf:type foaf:Person ;
    foaf:name "Alice Birpemswick" ;
    foaf::mbox "alice@example.com" ;
    foaf:phone "+1 617.555.7332" .


<div vocab="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/" typeof="Person">
   <p>
    <span property="name">Alice Birpemswick</span>,
    Email: <a property="mbox" href="mailto:alice@example.com">alice@example.com</a>,
    Phone: <a property="phone" href="tel:+1-617-555-7332">+1 617.555.7332</a>
  </p>
   <ul>
      <li property="knows" typeof="Person"><!-- outro blanknode -->
        <a property="homepage" href="http://example.com/bob/"><span property="name">Bob</span></a>
      </li>
      <li property="knows" typeof="Person">
        <a property="homepage" href="http://example.com/eve/"><span property="name">Eve</span></a>
      </li>
      <li property="knows" typeof="Person">
        <a property="homepage" href="http://example.com/manu/"><span property="name">Manu</span></a>
      </li>
   </ul>
</div>

FOAF convention: the URL that represents the person Alice is http://example.com/alice#me. It should not be confused with Alice's homepage, http://example.com/alice.


<div vocab="http://purl.org/dc/terms/">
   <div resource="/alice/posts/trouble_with_bob">
      <h2 property="title">The trouble with Bob</h2>
      <h3 property="creator" resource="#me">Alice</h3>
      ...
   </div>
</div>
   ...
<div class="sidebar" vocab="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/" resource="#me" typeof="Person">
  <p>
   <span property="name">Alice Birpemswick</span>,
     Email: <a property="mbox" href="mailto:alice@example.com">alice@example.com</a>,
     Phone: <a property="phone" href="tel:+1-617-555-7332">+1 617.555.7332</a>
  </p>
  ...
</div>

The resource attribute appears, in this case, together with property on the same element: in this situation resource indicates the "target" of the relation.
Combined with property, the resource attribute plays exactly the same role as href.


multiple prefix
<html>
 <head>
   ...
 </head>
 <body prefix="dc: http://purl.org/dc/terms/ schema: http://schema.org/"><!-- in body because meta UTF-8 must be at first 512 bytes -->
   <div resource="/alice/posts/trouble_with_bob" typeof="schema:BlogPosting">
      <h2 property="dc:title">The trouble with Bob</h2>
      ...
      <h3 property="dc:creator" resource="#me">Alice</h3>
      <div property="schema:articleBody">
        <p>The trouble with Bob is that he takes much better photos than I do:</p>
      </div>
     ...
   </div>
 </body>
</html>



RDFa allows the value of a property attribute to be a list of values
<html>
 <head>
   ...
 </head>
 <body prefix="dc: http://purl.org/dc/terms/ schema: http://schema.org/">
   <div resource="/alice/posts/trouble_with_bob" typeof="schema:BlogPosting">
      <h2 property="dc:title">The trouble with Bob</h2>
      ...
      <h3 property="dc:creator" resource="#me"><span property="schema:creator" resource="#me">Alice</span></h3>
      <div property="schema:articleBody">
        <p>The trouble with Bob is that he takes much better photos than I do:</p>
      </div>
     ...
   </div>
 </body>
</html>

<html>

 <body prefix="dc: http://purl.org/dc/terms/ schema: http://schema.org/">
   <div resource="/alice/posts/trouble_with_bob" typeof="schema:BlogPosting">

      ...
      <h3 property="dc:creator schema:creator" resource="#me">Alice</h3>
      <div property="schema:articleBody">
        <p>The trouble with Bob is that he takes much better photos than I do:</p>
      </div>
     ...
   </div>
 </body>
</html>
Similarly to property, typeof also accepts a list of values. For example, typeof="foaf:Person schema:Person"

 = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

RDFa Core

The aim of RDFa is to allow a single RDF graph to be carried in various types of document markup.

In RDFa, a subject IRI reference is generally indicated using @about and predicates are represented using one of @property, @rel, or @rev. 
Objects which are IRI references are represented using @resource, @src, or @href, whilst objects that are literals are represented either with @content or the content of the element in question (with an optional datatype expressed using @datatype, and an optional language expressed using a Host Language-defined mechanism such as @xml:lang).

output graph mean all of the triples asserted by a document
RDFa Processor MUST make available to a consuming application a single RDF graph containing all possible triples generated by using the rules in the Processing Model

about: is a 'subject'.
content: is a 'literal object'.
property: is a 'predicate'. Used for expressing relationships between a subject and either a resource object if given or some literal text
rel: is a 'predicate'. Used for expressing relationships between two resources.
rev: is a 'predicate'. Used for expressing reverse relationships between two resources.
resource: is a 'object'. 

<div about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Albert_Einstein">
  <span property="foaf:name">Albert Einstein</span>
  <span property="dbp:dateOfBirth" datatype="xsd:date">1879-03-14</span>
  <div rel="dbp:birthPlace" resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/German_Empire">
    <span property="dbp:conventionalLongName">the German Empire</span>
  </div>
</div>

<div about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Albert_Einstein">
  <div rel="dbp-owl:residence" resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/German_Empire"></div>
  <div rel="dbp-owl:residence" resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Switzerland"></div>
</div>
or with incomplete triple
<div about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Albert_Einstein" rel="dbp-owl:residence">
  <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/German_Empire"></span>
  <span about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Switzerland"></span>
</div>


<span property="http://purl.org/dc/terms/created" content="2011-09-10">10th of September, 2011</span>
<span property="dc:modified" content="2015-09-16T16:00:00-05:00" datatype="xsd:dateTime">16 September 2015</span>
<span property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:gYear">2011</span>

<ul>
  <li about="/alice/posts/trouble_with_bob" property="title">The trouble with Bob</li>
  <li about="/alice/posts/jos_barbecue" property="title">Jo's Barbecue</li>
  ...
</ul>
The fundamental difference between about and resource is that the former is only used to set the context, whether combined with the property attribute on the same element or not.


<div vocab="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/" resource="#me">
   <ul>
      <li property="knows" resource="http://example.com/bob/#me" typeof="Person">
        <a property="homepage" href="http://example.com/bob/"><span property="name">Bob</span></a>
      </li>
      <li property="knows" resource="http://example.com/eve/#me" typeof="Person">
        <a property="homepage" href="http://example.com/eve/"><span property="name">Eve</span></a>
      </li>
      <li property="knows" resource="http://example.com/manu/#me" typeof="Person">
        <a property="homepage" href="http://example.com/manu/"><span property="name">Manu</span></a>
      </li>
   </ul>
</div>
or
<div vocab="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/" resource="#me">
   <ul rel="knows">
      <li resource="http://example.com/bob/#me" typeof="Person">
        <a property="homepage" href="http://example.com/bob/"><span property="name">Bob</span></a>
      </li>
      <li resource="http://example.com/eve/#me" typeof="Person">
        <a property="homepage" href="http://example.com/eve/"><span property="name">Eve</span></a>
      </li>
      <li resource="http://example.com/manu/#me" typeof="Person">
        <a property="homepage" href="http://example.com/manu/"><span property="name">Manu</span></a>
      </li>
   </ul>
</div>
In simple cases the @property property can also be used in place of @rel. Indeed, in case when the element does not contain @rel, @datatype, or @content, but there is, for example, a @href, the effect of @property is analogous to the role of @rel.


<div about="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Albert_Einstein">
  <span property="foaf:name">Albert Einstein</span>
  <span property="dbp:dateOfBirth" datatype="xsd:date">1879-03-14</span>
  <div property="dbp:birthPlace" resource="http://dbpedia.org/resource/German_Empire">
    <span property="dbp:conventionalLongName">the German Empire</span>
  </div>
</div>
If use rel, the subject for 'the German Empire' would remain Albert Einstein (and that would, of course, be an error). This is the main difference between @property and @rel: the latter induces chaining, whereas the former, usually, does not.

<link about="_:john" rel="foaf:mbox" href="mailto:john@example.org" />
<link about="_:sue" rel="foaf:mbox"  href="mailto:sue@example.org" />
<link about="_:john" rel="foaf:knows" resource="_:sue" />


 If the current element contains no @rel or @rev attribute, then the next step is to establish a value for new subject. This step has two possible alternatives.

    If the current element contains the @property attribute, but does not contain either the @content or @datatype attributes, then
    new subject is set to the resource obtained from the first match from the following rule:
        by using the resource from @about, if present, obtained according to the section on CURIE and IRI Processing;
        otherwise, if the element is the root element of the document, then act as if there is an empty @about present, and process it according to the rule for @about, above;
        otherwise, if parent object is present, new subject is set to the value of parent object.

    If @typeof is present then typed resource is set to the resource obtained from the first match from the following rules:
        by using the resource from @about, if present, obtained according to the section on CURIE and IRI Processing;
        otherwise, if the element is the root element of the document, then act as if there is an empty @about present and process it according to the previous rule;
        otherwise,
            by using the resource from @resource, if present, obtained according to the section on CURIE and IRI Processing;
            otherwise, by using the IRI from @href, if present, obtained according to the section on CURIE and IRI Processing;
            otherwise, by using the IRI from @src, if present, obtained according to the section on CURIE and IRI Processing;
            otherwise, the value of typed resource is set to a newly created bnode.
            The value of the current object resource is then set to the value of typed resource.
    otherwise:
        If the element contains an @about, @href, @src, or @resource attribute, new subject is set to the resource obtained as follows:
            by using the resource from @about, if present, obtained according to the section on CURIE and IRI Processing;
            otherwise, by using the resource from @resource, if present, obtained according to the section on CURIE and IRI Processing;
            otherwise, by using the IRI from @href, if present, obtained according to the section on CURIE and IRI Processing;
            otherwise, by using the IRI from @src, if present, obtained according to the section on CURIE and IRI Processing.
        otherwise, if no resource is provided by a resource attribute, then the first match from the following rules will apply:
            if the element is the root element of the document, then act as if there is an empty @about present, and process it according to the rule for @about, above;
            otherwise, if @typeof is present, then new subject is set to be a newly created bnode;
            otherwise, if parent object is present, new subject is set to the value of parent object. Additionally, if @property is not present then the skip element flag is set to 'true'.

        Finally, if @typeof is present, set the typed resource to the value of new subject.

If the current element does contain a @rel or @rev attribute, then the next step is to establish both a value for new subject and a value for current object resource:
new subject is set to the resource obtained from the first match from the following rules:

    by using the resource from @about, if present, obtained according to the section on CURIE and IRI Processing;

if the @typeof attribute is present, set typed resource to new subject.

If no resource is provided then the first match from the following rules will apply:

    if the element is the root element of the document then act as if there is an empty @about present, and process it according to the rule for @about, above;
    otherwise, if parent object is present, new subject is set to that.

Then the current object resource is set to the resource obtained from the first match from the following rules:

    by using the resource from @resource, if present, obtained according to the section on CURIE and IRI Processing;
    otherwise, by using the IRI from @href, if present, obtained according to the section on CURIE and IRI Processing;
    otherwise, by using the IRI from @src, if present, obtained according to the section on CURIE and IRI Processing;
    otherwise, if @typeof is present and @about is not, use a newly created bnode.

If @typeof is present and @about is not, set typed resource to current object resource.

Note that final value of the current object resource will either be null (from initialization) or a full IRI or bnode.


<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <head>
    <title>Jo's Blog</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><span property="dc:creator">Jo</span>'s blog</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my blog.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>

which would still generate the triple:
<> dc:creator "Jo" .


<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <head>
    <base href="http://www.example.org/jo/blog" />

    <meta property="dc:creator" content="Jo" />
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
  </body>
</html>

An RDFa Processor should now generate the following triples, regardless of the IRI from which the document is served:
<http://www.example.org/jo/blog> foaf:primaryTopic <http://www.example.org//jo/blog#bbq> .
<http://www.example.org/jo/blog> dc:creator "Jo" .

  <div rel="dbp:birthPlace" typeof="http://schema.org/Country">

  </div>
</div>

generates:
<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Albert_Einstein"> dbp:birthPlace _:b .
_:b dbp:conventionalLongName "the German Empire" .



<h2 property="dc:title" datatype="rdf:XMLLiteral">
  E = mc<sup>2</sup>: The Most Urgent Problem of Our Time

This would generate the following triple, with the XML preserved in the literal:
<> dc:title "E = mc<sup>2</sup>: The Most Urgent Problem of Our Time"^^rdf:XMLLiteral .
